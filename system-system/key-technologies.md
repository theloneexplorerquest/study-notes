# Core Database
Product deisng interview take relational database, infrasturcture design take NoSQL database
NoSQL and SQL are highly overlapping: noSQL can work great for relation, SQL can scale and performance as well.
Truth: no need to explicit comparion of SQL and NoSQL, you should avoid it. Instead, talk about why you know about the databse and how it will help you solve the problem at hand.
For compare, focus on the differences in the database you are familar with and how they would impact your design.

# Relational Database
1. SQL Joins
2. Indexes (allow faster query, B-tree of HashTable), support for arbitrarily many indexes.
3. Transactions: way to group multiple operations together.
