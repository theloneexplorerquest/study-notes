Why we need distributed lock:
1. Efficiency: Taking a lock saves you from unnecessarily doing the same work twice
2. Correctness: Taking a lock prevents concurrent processes from stepping on each othersâ€™ toes and messing up the state of your system.
If merely for efficiency purpose, it is unnecessary to incur the cost and complexity of redlock.
